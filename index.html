        Honor Code
        To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the university community, have set forth this honor code: Student members of the George Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work.
        <br>
        A full reading of the Honor Code and the associated system can be found at our website.

        Please note there is a separate process for individuals accused of research misconduct. As it states in policy 4007, "Allegations of academic misconduct against graduate students are governed solely by the university honor code, except for:
        <br>
        research activities as defined above regardless of sponsorship; and
        master's theses and doctoral dissertations, both of which are governed by this policy.
        Allegations of academic misconduct against undergraduate students are governed solely by the university honor code, except for sponsored research activities which are governed by this policy." Questions related to research misconduct that fall under this category should be directed to the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance at the following link: https://rdia.gmu.edu/topics-of-interest/research-misconduct/.
